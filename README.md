# ExpenseTracker

### Background and problem
Managing personal finance has become more intricate and crucial than ever before due to the complexity of modern life. So it is important to monitor the details of spending habits and track the overall flow of money. 
But it will be an inconvenience to make personal finance recordings and analyses of spending habits without using any helper tools. 

### Scope of application
This application will focus on tracking the expenses of users and provide convenient tools to show the necessary detail for better money management. Take the userâ€™s income and outcome as input to compute and return the output as data with visualizations. 

### Technologies Used
[GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) - Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.

[YCharts](https://github.com/codeandtheory/YCharts) - Jetpack-compose based charts library which enables developers to easily integrate various types of charts/graphs into their existing ui to visually represent statistical data.
